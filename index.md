## What is FLUX? 
FLUX is University of Michigan's High Performance Computing cluster. It is maintained by [ARC-TS](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/systems-and-services/flux/). ARC-TS runs frequent [workshops](http://cscar.research.umich.edu/hpc-workshops/) on how to use FLUX.
This tutorial serves as a supplement to their HPC101 course with specific examples of how to run [mothur](http://www.mothur.org/) and some additional tricks.

## Getting flux help:
The flux support at UM is terrific! If you're having an issue or you want to have some software installed on flux, send them an email at
